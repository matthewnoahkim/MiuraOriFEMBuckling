# MiuraOriFEMBuckling

This project is very much work in progress.

Any code editor for Java works. I use eclipse IDE to write/run the program. MainApp.java is the main method and when it is run, a java window with the Miura visualization will pop up. Note that currently the CSV file data import isn't working.
